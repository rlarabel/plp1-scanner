# PLp1 Scanner

Due Date: *Monday, January 22, 2023 @ 8am*

## Purpose

This project is intended to give you experience constructing a
scanner in the Java programming language.

## Project Summary

Your task is to construct a scanner that accepts
the regular expressions defining the PLp1 programming language. Your code will emit the stream of tokens (terminals) found in the input, if the input is in the language generated by PLp1's regular expressions. Once an `ERROR` token is returned, scanning may stop.


## The Scanner

You are to construct a scanner using the method discussed in class. You may use another method; however, the method in class is straightforward.


1. Read the documentation in the file [plp1re.md](plp1re.md).

1. Define the character classes for PLp1.

1. Construct the DFA for PLp1's regular expressions.

1. Implement the DFA in Java in the file `scanner.java`.

1. When you push your code, it will be automatically graded. Note that there a number of tests per test file. For instance, `test_basic.java` has forty-five tests. GitHub Classroom does not give partial points, so you will only get points if the all forty-five tests are correct. However, we will examine the output of the test runs and give you the partial points for whichever of the forty-five tests you get correct.

## API

Below is the API for the scanner. It may not be changed.

```Java
   /**
     * Create a new PLp1Scanner
     */
   public PLp1Scanner()

    /**
     * Add input string for processing
     * @param input
     * @return the PLp1Scanner
     */
    public PLp1Scanner addInput(String input)

   /**
     * Get the next token in the input stream
     * @return the next token
     */
    public Token getNextToken() 
```
## Implementation Notes

1. Whitespace (spaces, newlines, and tabs) is not a token and is used to separate tokens only. It should not appear as part of any token and should be ingored by your scanner.

1. For variables and numbers, whitespace  plus any symbol (*e.g.*, `+`) terminates the token.

1. Encountering any character not found in the regular expressions given in [plp1re.md](plp1re.md), results in an error.

1. Strings may not cross a line boundary. Thus, encountering a newline inside a quoted string is an error.

1. Comments end with a newline character or the end of input.

1. In Java, there is not end of string characer like in C (*i.e.*, `'\0'`). So, the input ends when the are no more characters.

1. If the scanner is called and there is no more input left to process, the token `EOF` should be returned.

## Testing

All testing uses `JUnit 4`. I have written a `Makefile` that is used for running these tests. There are three test input files in the `src/test` directory that **may not be edited**: `test_basic.java`, `test_errors.java`, and `test_adv.java`. To test your code, you can run a single test file using a `make` command from the command line in the top level directory where `Makefile` resides: `make test_basic`, `make test_errors`, or `make test_adv`. To run all three test files you can run `make unit`. To only compile your code, just run `make`.

## Requirements

Your code must be written in Java and submitted via git.
